# Alpha
A terrible name, but a good cause.

I don't know what this will be yet, but 
hopefully it will be my first shipped game.

### Things to do:
- Mouse input.
- Entity system (entity component) 
- extract a "draw\_sprite" from the main method.
- Camera implementation.
((Maybe entity component actually, since it's more inline with the procedural style.))
- Factor out a draw sprite.
- Instant GUI.
- Maybe a file format for drawing animated sprites.
- Clean up the Windows build. It's kinda annoying how it names the .exe "windows" and that there are 3 batch files.
- Visual Scripting Language
Maybe make this just compile down to a very simple and limited scripting language...
With some extra data for visuals offcourse.
