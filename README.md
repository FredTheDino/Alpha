# Alpha
A terrible name, but a good cause.

I don't know what this will be yet, but 
hopefully it will be my first shipped game.

### Things to do:
- Entity system (entity component) 
((Maybe entity component system actually, since it's more inline with the procedural DO style.))
- Text rendering.
- Instant GUI.
- Maybe a file format for drawing animated sprites. With animations and sprite specifications. 
- Clean up the Windows build. It's kinda annoying how it names the .exe "windows" and that there are 3 batch files.
- Visual Scripting Language (Not sure...)
Maybe make this just compile down to a very simple and limited scripting language...
With some extra data for visuals offcourse. But that would just be limiting...
Really not thinking in kinds of visual scripting, I don't know how use full it is...
It would be good for things like making doors move and stuff like that.

# DUDE!!!
Check if backface culling is doing so the post processing won't work!
