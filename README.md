# Alpha
A terrible name, but a good cause.

I don't know what this will be yet, but 
hopefully it will be my first shipped game.

### Things to do:
#### More Relevent
- Entities are now just a bunch of pointers, an update and a draw.
- Collisions (A way to bind a body to a sprite)

#### Not So Relevent
- Instant GUI mode.
- Maybe a file format for drawing animated sprites. With animations and sprite specifications. 
- Clean up the Windows build. It's kinda annoying how it names the .exe "windows" and that there are 3 batch files, it's dumb, that's what it is.


### Game Idea
A game about lonelyness.
